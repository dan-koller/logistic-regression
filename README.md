# Logistic Regression

This is a simple logistic regression model implemented in python. It uses the breast cancer dataset from sklearn. The dataset contains 569 samples and 30 features. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## Requirements

-   Python 3
-   Packages from `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dan-koller/logistic-regression
```

2. Create a virtual environment\*

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment\*

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the requirements\*

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the app\*

```bash
python3 main.py
```

_\*) You might need to use python and pip instead of python3 and pip3 depending on your system._

## Usage

The app will run and print the accuracy of the model. The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. The model is trained using gradient descent. The learning rate and number of iterations can be changed in `main.py`.

The app prints the mse, accuracy and loss for the training and testing data and compares the custom model to the sklearn model.

The output is plotted and saved to `data/graph.png` and looks like this:
